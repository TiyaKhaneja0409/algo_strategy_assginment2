💰 Problem 2 – Maximizing Profit with Limited Budget (Dynamic Programming – 0/1 Knapsack)

Algorithm: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming
Domain: Budget Planning / Investment

🔹 Approach

Construct a DP table of size n × capacity.

Compute the best profit by including/excluding each item.⚙ Complexities
Metric	Theoretical Complexity
Time	O(n × capacity)
Space	O(n × capacity)
📊 Observations

Execution time and memory scale linearly with both n and capacity.

Optimal results but heavy on memory for large capacities.
