🔐 Problem 4 – Password Cracking (Brute Force)

Algorithm: Brute-Force Search
Domain: Cybersecurity / Password Strength Testing

🔹 Approach

Generate all possible character combinations from a given charset until a match is found.⚙ Complexities
Metric	Theoretical Complexity
Time	O(cᴸ) (where c = charset size, L = password length)
Space	O(1) (constant)
📊 Observations

Time increases exponentially with password length.

Memory remains nearly constant.

Demonstrates why long, complex passwords are secure.
